### Run
The easiest way to run this app rn is to just run the command ./run.bat```, which just runs the run command for streamlit and opens up the site.

### UI Updates
Changed the color scheme to match Catpuccin Mocha, making it look kinda nice tho.
Made it a multi-page app that is swapable between the left side sidebar that responds to mobile too (altho its not gonna be used in mobile but still i get bragging rights).

That's all! Let me know if you have any questions! :)
