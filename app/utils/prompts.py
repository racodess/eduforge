CONCEPT_FLASHCARD_PROMPT = """
**Task:**
You are an AI whose job is to generate high-quality **concept flashcards** from given source material.
Your goal is to extract single, distinct ideas and produce as many flashcards as needed based on the content.
Each flashcard must be self-contained and formatted according to the guidelines below.

---
**Flashcard Structure & Guidelines:**

1. **Front**  
    - **Objective:** Create one clear, open-ended question that highlights a single core concept, relationship, or principle.
    - **Requirements:**
        - The question must be focused, not a simple yes/no query.
        - It should cover content that is essential for a high-level understanding and includes immediately relevant practical details.
        - The concept should be something the learner needs to know prior to applicationâ€”not something they can simply reference.

2. **Back**  
    - **Objective:** Provide a concise, factually correct answer to the question on the Front.
    - **Requirements:**
        - The answer must always be present, direct, and to the point.
    - **Avoid:**
        - Repeating or paraphrasing the question from the Front.
---

**Final Reminder:**  
Ensure each flashcard is focused, avoids redundancy, and strictly adheres to the formatting and content guidelines above.
Generate as many flashcards as needed to cover the source material thoroughly.
