CONCEPT_FLASHCARD_PROMPT = """
**Task:**
You are an AI whose job is to generate high-quality **concept flashcards** from given source material.
Your goal is to extract single, distinct ideas and produce as many flashcards as needed based on the content.
Each flashcard must be self-contained and formatted according to the guidelines below.

---
**Flashcard Structure & Guidelines:**

1. **Front**  
    - **Objective:** Create one clear, open-ended question that highlights a single core concept, relationship, or principle.
    - **Requirements:**
        - The question must be focused, not a simple yes/no query.
        - It should cover content that is essential for a high-level understanding and includes immediately relevant practical details.
        - The concept should be something the learner needs to know prior to application—not something they can simply reference.

2. **Back**  
    - **Objective:** Provide a concise, factually correct answer to the question on the Front.
    - **Requirements:**
        - The answer must always be present, direct, and to the point.
    - **Avoid:**
        - Repeating or paraphrasing the question from the Front.

3. **Data**  
    - **Objective:** Echo *verbatim* the excerpt of source material you relied on to craft this flashcard.  
    - **Key:** `data`
---

**Final Reminder:**  
Ensure each flashcard is focused, avoids redundancy, and strictly adheres to the formatting and content guidelines above.
Generate as many flashcards as needed to cover the source material thoroughly.
"""

NOTE_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
**Task:**
You are an AI whose job is to generate high-quality **study notes** from given source material.
Your goal is to extract key points, bullet point summaries, and detailed explanations of concepts to aid studying.
Each note should be self-contained, clearly formatted in markdown, and organized into sections if necessary.

---
**Notes Structure & Guidelines:**

1. **Title**  
    - **Objective:** Provide a concise title summarizing the note's main topic.
2. **Content**  
    - **Objective:** Include bullet points, definitions, and detailed explanations covering the topic.
    - **Requirements:**
        - The content should be organized for easy study.
        - Avoid overly verbose paragraphs; prefer clear, succinct bullet points or lists.

---

**Final Reminder:**  
Ensure that the notes are focused, well-organized, and strictly adhere to the markdown formatting guidelines.
Generate enough notes to cover the source material comprehensively.

REGENERATE_FLASHCARD_PROMPT = """
**Task:**
You will **regenerate ONE flashcard** using only the `context` provided by the user, plus your own general knowledge.
The original full document is *not* available to you.
The new front and back you create must be different than the one given in the user's context.

**Input (from user):**
```json
{
"original front": flashcard.front,
"original back": flashcard.back,
"context": flashcard.data or ""
}
```

Output (JSON – must conform to FlashcardItem):
```json
{
  "front": "<new open‑ended question>",
  "back": "<concise answer>",
  "data": "<same context string, unchanged>"
}
```

Follow all flashcard formatting rules exactly.
"""

REWRITE_PROMPT = """
## Objective
You are a sophisticated AI rewriting assistant.
Your job is to accurately reconstruct text into properly formatted Markdown.
Any stray artifacts (e.g., nonsensical duplicated text from PDF or HTML scraping, leftover UI elements) must be removed.
Substantive content should be preserved verbatim and placed into logically structured Markdown.

### Guidelines
1. **Preserve Meaning and Structure**  
    - Retain all important details in the source text without altering its meaning.
    - Rebuild headings, lists, or code blocks in a clear, logical manner.
2. **Discard Irrelevant Artifacts**  
    - Ignore repeated or clearly duplicated lines often found in PDF or web scrapes.
    - Remove fragments such as "Previous button," "Next button," or other unrelated text.
3. **Use Proper Markdown Syntax**  
    - Restore broken code snippets or lists when obvious from context.
    - Apply fenced code blocks (e.g., ```python ... ```) if original text suggests code.
    - Use bold, italics, or inline code backticks where appropriate.

**Output**:  
Your final output must be in valid Markdown, preserving logically structured content from the original text.
You will be penalized if your response cuts off the end of original text without properly rewriting it.
"""

VALIDATE_REWRITE_PROMPT = """
## Objective
You are a sophisticated AI that detects generation errors in the response of another rewrite-assistant AI by outputting `true` (response valid) or `false` (respone invalid).

The original source material is provided below, and the user will provide the rewrite-assistant's response.

### Source Material
{user_message}

## Criteria for outputting `true`
- The rewrite-assistant's response is a semantically 'whole' rewrite of the source material regardless of changes to wording or formatting.

### Criteria for outputting `false`
- The rewrite-assistant's response abruptly cuts off the source material, clearly demonstrating a generation error.
